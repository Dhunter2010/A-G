    <h1>Ready to start to play guitar?</h1>

    <strong><p>I have been playing guitar for almost 10 years. <br>
Getting started playing any instrument will become a challenge, <br> but with the right teaching
you can get started today.<br> I have learned from many people how to play guitar on youtube and some friends
    </p>

    <h2>My Guitar Struggles</h2>
<p>Learning the basics can be very fun and also very frustating.
I started looking at many youtube video most videos were very good but there was lots more stuff you had to
learn before you could fully understand it.</p></strong>

<h2>What Will We Learn</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Scales</li>
  <li>Chords</li>
  <li>Proper Guitar Playing</li>
  <li>And Much Much More</li>
</ul>
